# JavaScript DOM Manipulation Examples

This project demonstrates various JavaScript concepts including DOM manipulation, variable declarations, data types, and loop structures. It serves as a learning resource for web development fundamentals.

## Project Structure

- [`index.html`](index.html) - Main HTML file demonstrating DOM element modification
- [`main.html`](main.html) - HTML file for creating and removing DOM elements
- [`dom-script.js`](dom-script.js) - Script for direct DOM manipulation
- [`script.js`](script.js) - Script for creating and removing DOM elements
- [`dom.js`](dom.js) - Examples of different DOM selection methods
- [`variable.js`](variable.js) - JavaScript variable types and data structures
- [`loops.js`](loops.js) - JavaScript loop structures and examples

## Features

### DOM Manipulation Techniques
- Selecting elements using different methods
- Modifying text content of elements
- Setting element attributes

- Reference data types (Objects, Arrays)
- Type conversion examples
- Various loop structures with examples

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open either [`index.html`](index.html) or [`main.html`](main.html) in a web browser
3. Check the browser console (F12) to see additional output
